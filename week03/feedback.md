# Week 3 Feedback
Each week, you'll receive a feedback file in GitHub showing a final grade and any specific comments on your assignment, including why points (if any) were deducted.


## Final Score: 9.5/10

## Multiple Choice:
_Did you complete and submit the multiple choice part of the assignment?_
* Complete

## Functionality: 
_Did your code do what the assignment required?_
* All code worked as expected

## Coding Best Practices:
_Was your code readable, efficient, and in line with what we learned in class?_
* Good variable names?
  * **(-0.5) variable names like `rr` and `point_1`, `point_2` etc aren't very descriptive. Use names that reflect what the variable means.**
* Code written into functions where appropriate?
* Appropriate comments with your code?
* Generally easy to follow and undersand?
  * **When you write multiple if/elif/else blocks, it is helpful to put a blank line between them for readability.  So, a blank line after you finish the conditions for `length_of_stay` when you start doing the conditions for `acute_flag`**
